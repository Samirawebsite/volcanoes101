<h1> Lava Domes </h1>
	
Lava domes also known as volcanic domes, can come in many shapes and sizes. It is a pile of relatively viscous lava that cannot flow far from the vent. Because they are made up viscous lava, domes are usually steep-sided. They typically have rough brecciated surfaces, and sometimes they have glassy rinds due to quenching of the hot lava once it was erupted onto the surface. Most domes are relatively small volcanoes with limited volume (Tienrey, 2010).

<h2> How do they form? </h2>

Some dome-forming eruptions start with highly explosive eruptions that wane into dome-building ones as the gas content in the magma decreases. Other dome-building eruptions beging effusively until the growing dome explodes or collpases to produce pyroclastic flows. Domes are usually made up of silica lavas since high viscosity is necessary to form domes(Tienrey, 2010).
