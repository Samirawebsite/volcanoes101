            <h2> Welcome to Volcanoes 101! </h2>


            Volcanoes 101 is all about types of volcanoes, how they are formed, most notable volcanic eruptions, and all
            the fun facts!


            <h3> What are volcanoes? </h3>

            A volcano is an opening in the earth's crust through which lava, volcanic ash, and gasses escape. Volcanic
            eruptions are partly driven by pressure from dissolved gas. Beneath a volcano, liquid magma containing
            dissolved gasses rises through cracks in the Earth's crust. As the magma rises, pressure decreases, allowing
            the gasses to form bubbles. (Government of Canada, 2024)
