<h1> Cinder Cones</h1>
	
Cinder cones, also known as pyroclastic cones, are the smallest and simplest type of volcano. They are the world's most common volcanic landform. They get their name "cinder cond," by being cone-shaped hills made up of ejected igneous rocks known as "cinders."

They usually have a circular footprint, and their flanks usually slope at an angle of about 30-40 degrees. Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the top (King, 2025). 


<h2> How do they form?</h2>

Cinder cones form when molten rock known as "magma" approaches Earth's surface. The magma that forms cinder cones contains a LOT of dissovled gas. This gas is what powers a cinder cone equation. 

When the magma breaks through Earth's surface, the confining pressure on the gas is removed. The release of confining pressure causes the gas to expand as an explosive eruption that launches a spray of molten rock into the air. 

The molten rock cools as it flies through the air, and the cinders rain down onto the surrounding landscape. The cinders that land close to the vent is what builds the cone shape (King, 2025).
