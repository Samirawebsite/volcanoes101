<h1> Composite Volcanoes </h1>
	
A classic composite volcano can be described as conical with a concave shape that is steeper near the top. These mountains commonly have snow-covered peaks standing high above the surrounding mountainous terrain. Composite volcanoes are also called stratovolcanoes (National Park Service, 2023). 


<h2> How do they form? </h2>

Composite volcanoes are built up by successive eruptions of domes, lava flows and pyroclasic flows, as well as large blasts that destroy large aeas of their summits. Landsldies may occur during eruptions. The repeated eruptions of viscous lava and ash build up alternating layers of hardened lava and tephra over time, creating their steep, conical shape (National Park Service, 2023).
