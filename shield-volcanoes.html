<h1> Shield Volcanoes </h1>
	
Shield volcanoes are a type of volcano that erupts basalt lava. Since basalt has a low viscosity, it can flow on the surface better. Therefore, when shield volcanos erupt, lava flows outwards at large distances. The conduit is the main pipe from the magma chamber to the summit. If it gets plugged into hardened lava, lava can flow thorugh dykes at the side of the volcano. The dyke is connected to a fissure, which is just a crack in the side of a shield volcano. This creates lava alone the side of the volcano (EarthHow, 2019). 

<h2> How do they form? </h2>

A shield volcano is built mainly out of basaltic lava of low viscosity. The lava flows out, cools and hardens, adding to layers of cooled and hardened lava underneath it. This process creates a gradual increase in elevation over time resulting in the formation of shield volcanoes (ByJu's, 2025).
